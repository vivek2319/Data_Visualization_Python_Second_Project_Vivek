*Human resource analytics (HR analytics) is an area in the field of analytics that refers to applying analytic processes to the human resource department of an organization in the hope of improving employee performance and therefore getting a better return on investment.*

## Dataset  
[Human Resource Analytics - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ludobenistant/hr-analytics)


## Information 

* Note: This dataset is simulated.

Why are our best and most experienced employees leaving prematurely? Have fun with this database and try to predict which valuable employees will leave next. Fields in the dataset include:

    -Satisfaction Level
    -Last evaluation
    -Number of projects
    -Average monthly hours
    -Time spent at the company
    -Whether they have had a work accident
    -Whether they have had a promotion in the last 5 years
    -Departments (column sales)
    -Salary
    -Whether the employee has left



* Summary: We loaded the dataset with csv file. We then took a look at data, pre-processed it. We also created [heatmap](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.heatmap.html) , [distribution plot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.distplot.html) , [boxplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.boxplot.html) , and produced regression line using [lmplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.lmplot.html) . For this project, we used various packages, such as [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), and [Seaborn](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/seaborn).
